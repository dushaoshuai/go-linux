# cat written in Golang
Usage information is roughly the same as [GNU cat](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/cat) or available locally via: `./cat --help` .  
No long options other than `-help` and `-version` .

Bug: -v option doesn't work.

Comments: `-n` is the same as `--n` , `--` stops options parsing.
